# Truss-Bridge-Design-for-Two-Lane-Highway-Civil-Engineering-Project-Using-AutoCAD
This repository presents the complete design, analysis, and evaluation of a truss bridge developed for a two-lane highway crossing a river valley, in line with the Australian bridge design standards. The project covers multiple aspects including conceptual modeling, structural analysis, environmental impact assessment, cost estimation .

📄 Project Overview
The goal of this civil design project is to develop a structurally sound, cost-effective, and environmentally responsible bridge that satisfies modern infrastructure demands. The project explores two design proposals, evaluates material choices, performs joint force analysis, and considers long-term feasibility.

🧩 Key Components <br>
🔧 Design Models
Design Proposal 1: Steel truss (Pratt/Warren) + reinforced concrete deck |
Design Proposal 2: Entire structure in reinforced concrete (panty & deck)

Each model is assessed for: <br>
Load capacity (live & dead loads) |
Shear, bending, axial forces |
Stability & constructability |
Environmental impact

📐 Structural Design <br>
Member force analysis (tension & compression) |
Joint equilibrium calculations |
Bending moment & shear force diagrams |
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) via Staad.Pro/SAP2000 |
AutoCAD-based modeling and dimensioning

📊 Material & Cost Evaluation <br>
Member tables for both models (section size, length, force type) |
Detailed cost breakdown:
Material costs (steel grades, concrete, fabrication) |
Excavation, supports, fabrication & connection costs |
Deck construction and site costs

🌱 Environmental Impact Assessment <br>
Design 1: Land-based impact (soil compaction, emissions) |
Design 2: River-based impact (aquatic disturbance, flow changes) |
Risk mitigation strategies & sustainable practices
